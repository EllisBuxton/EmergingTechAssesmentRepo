# Natural Language Processing Projects

[![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/ellisbuxton/EmergingTechAssesmentRepo/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ellisbuxton/EmergingTechAssesmentRepo/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This repository contains two key natural language processing implementations:

## 1. ELIZA Chatbot
A modern recreation of Joseph Weizenbaum's 1966 natural language processing program.

### Features
- Pattern matching using regular expressions
- Context-aware responses
- Web-based interface
- Rogerian psychotherapist simulation

### Try It Live
[Try the ELIZA chatbot here](https://ellisbuxton.github.io/EmergingTechAssesmentRepo/eliza/)

### Research Context
Based on foundational work in natural language processing:
- Weizenbaum, J. (1966). "ELIZA—A Computer Program For the Study of Natural Language Communication Between Man and Machine"
- Colby, K. M. (1975). "Artificial Paranoia: A Computer Simulation of Paranoid Process"

## 2. Trigram Language Model
A statistical language model using character-level trigrams for text analysis and generation.

### Features
- Character-level trigram analysis
- Statistical text generation
- Model persistence in JSON format
- Accuracy analysis against English dictionary

### Performance
- Generates text with ~36.67% valid English words
- Based on analysis of five classic literary works
- JSON-based model storage for efficiency

### Research Context
Built on fundamental statistical language modeling research:
- Shannon, C.E. (1948). "A Mathematical Theory of Communication"
- Manning, C.D. & Schütze, H. (1999). "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing"

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser for ELIZA
- Python 3.x for trigram model
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
